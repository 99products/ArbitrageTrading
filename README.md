# ArbitrageTrading
Arbitrage is trading that exploits the tiny differences in price between identical assets in two or more markets. The arbitrage trader buys the asset in one market and sells it in the other market at the same time in order to pocket the difference between the two prices

Here we are trying to do it between binance and wazirx.

Note:  With more and more users, arbitrage becomes a rare event, and may not work always, and even if does it will last only for a short time window.

This project aims at leveraging binance and wazirx api to give a start to use and understand how crypto exchanges work ( ask, bid etc.)
